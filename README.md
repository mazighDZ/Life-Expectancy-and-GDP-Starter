This analysis has been published [here](https://medium.com/@mazirskysass/from-data-to-discovery-eda-and-visualisation-with-python-4cf173fbe5ef) â€” feel free to have a look!

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** around the information regarding **Life Expectancy** and **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** for 6 different countries between the years of 2000 and 2015.

With this information, we'll be able to:

- Find if there's a correlation between the given variables;
- Understand the evolution in Life Expectancy and GDP over the years for each country;
- Compare the variables between countries.

## Dataset

The dataset provided has the following columns of data:

- **Country** - nation
- **Year** - the year for the observation
- **Life expectancy at birth (years)** - life expectancy value in years
- **GDP** - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars

## Analysis

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
